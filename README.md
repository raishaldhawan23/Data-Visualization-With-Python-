# From Sourcing to Revenue: An In-depth Analysis of Supply Chain for a Fashion and Beauty Startup

## Executive Summary
This project focuses on enhancing the operations and processes of Supply Chain Analytics through the creation of an interactive dashboard, which serves as the central feature. The dashboard provides insights into the startupâ€™s supply chain data, uncovering hidden patterns that support strategic decision-making. It includes a comprehensive overview of the project's goals, theoretical background, and methodology, backed by visualization theories and analysis techniques. Links to the dataset and a reflective blog provide additional transparency and context for the project, detailing the design process, challenges encountered, and skills gained. The project delivers actionable insights aimed at assisting senior leaders in optimizing supply chain efficiency, cost management, and customer satisfaction.

## Project Structure
- Supply_Chain_Data.csv: Contains structured supply chain data with 24 columns, including metrics for stock levels, lead times, product types, and more.
- Supply_Chain_Dashboard.py: The primary Python code file for creating the interactive dashboard. It uses the Dash Framework with Plotly and Pandas to visualize data and track key metrics.
- README.md: This document provides an overview of the project, the structure of the repository, and instructions for running the analysis.

## Project Goals
- Optimize Inventory Management: Balance stock levels to meet demand while avoiding overstock.
- Improve Supply Chain Efficiency: Reduce lead times and streamline shipping processes.
- Enhance Customer Satisfaction: Focus on timely deliveries and aligning products with customer demographics.
  
## Getting Started
To run this project, install the necessary Python libraries:

<pre>
  bash
  pip install pandas plotly dash
</pre>

## Methodology
- Data Collection and Integrity: A structured dataset was sourced to capture relevant supply chain metrics. It was verified for consistency and completeness.
- Dashboard Design: Developed using the Dash Framework, each visualization in the dashboard focuses on specific supply chain KPIs like stock levels, transportation costs, and product demand patterns.
- Descriptive and Predictive Analytics: The dashboard incorporates analytics methods, including historical data visualization (e.g., stock levels distribution) and forecasting (e.g., product demand prediction).
  
## Visualization Techniques
- Descriptive Analytics: Includes histograms and pie charts to understand current supply chain performance and inventory turnover.
- Predictive Analytics: Uses trend lines and predictive models to forecast demand and identify optimization opportunities.

## Key Visualizations
- Stock Levels Distribution: A histogram to analyze stock levels and identify peak demand periods.
- Product Prices and Revenue Correlation: A scatter plot with trend lines to show the relationship between pricing and revenue, aiding inventory prioritization.

## Conclusion
This project successfully creates a supply chain analytics dashboard for a fashion and beauty startup, aligning with the goals of operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The insights provided by this dashboard equip senior leaders with data-driven strategies for supply chain optimization and decision-making.
